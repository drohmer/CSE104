# CSE 104

## How to view the exercices

The exercices and codes are hosted online ([github](https://github.com/)).

Exercices are written in _readme.md_ files ([Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). The content of these files can be read:
1. Directly online in the github directory (require internet connection)
2. Offline using a [markdown viewer in your browser or adapted text editor]().

## How to navigate

Exercices are stored by topics. Each topic is stored in a separated directory and subdirectory.
* Navigate in the exercices in selecting a specific directory (ex. A_html/css/01_html_basic)
* Some exercice may be provided as code in _/src_ directory.

_Note_ 
* Different directories may have varying length and complexity.
* Topics are thought to be followed in the order of the directories.

To access to the content of the lab class and the code, you should also download the entire structure on your computer.
