# CSE 104

## How to view the exercices

The exercices and codes are hosted online (using [github](https://github.com/)).

Exercices are written in _readme.md_ files ([Markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)). The content of these files can be read either
1. Directly online in the github directory (require internet connection)
2. Offline using a [markdown viewer in your browser or adapted text editor](https://imagecomputing.net/damien.rohmer/teaching/general/markdown_viewer/index.html).

## How to navigate

Exercices are stored by topics. Each topic is stored in a separated directory and subdirectory.
* Navigate in the exercices in selecting a specific directory (ex. [A_html_css/](A_html_css/), and then [A_html_css/01_html_basic/](A_html_css/01_html_basic/))
* Some exercices may be provided as code in _/src/_ directories.

_Note_ 
* Different directories may have varying length and complexity.
* Topics are thought to be followed in the order of the directories.
